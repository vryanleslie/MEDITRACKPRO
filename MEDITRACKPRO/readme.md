## Installation

To set up the database for the MediTrack-Pro app, follow these steps:

1. **Download or Clone the Repository**:
   - You can either download or clone the repository to your local machine.

2. **Set Up the Database**:
   - Open your MySQL database management tool (like phpMyAdmin or MySQL Workbench).
   - Create a new database called `meditrack`.
   - Run the `database.sql` script in phpMyAdmin or through the MySQL command line.
   - This will create the necessary tables (`users`, `products`, `sales`, `purchases`).

3. **Edit Configuration (Optional)**:
   - If necessary, you can adjust database credentials in the `db.php` file to match your local or live database credentials.
